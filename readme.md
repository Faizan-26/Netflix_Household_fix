# Netflix Household Fix Extension

A Chrome extension that temporarily blocks Netflix GraphQL requests to help with household sharing authentication issues.

## Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **Smart Blocking**: Automatically blocks `https://web.prod.cloud.netflix.com/graphql` for 10 seconds when navigating to Netflix pages
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Countdown Timer**: Visual countdown showing when the blocking will be lifted
- üîÑ **Auto-Refresh Protection**: Blocks GraphQL requests again when any Netflix page is refreshed
- üéØ **Targeted Blocking**: Only blocks on specific Netflix URLs (`/browse` and `/watch/`)
- üé® **Beautiful UI**: Modern popup interface with real-time status updates
- üì± **Non-Intrusive Notifications**: Elegant in-page notifications that don't steal focus

## How It Works

1. **Browse Page Detection**: When you visit `https://www.netflix.com/browse`, the extension blocks GraphQL requests for 5 seconds
2. **Watch Page Detection**: When you navigate to any `https://www.netflix.com/watch/` URL, blocking is triggered again
3. **Refresh Protection**: Any page refresh on Netflix will trigger a new 5-second block
4. **Smart Unblocking**: After 5 seconds, GraphQL requests are automatically allowed again
